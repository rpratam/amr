# Introduction to AMR Analysis Pipeline

Antimicrobial Resistance (AMR) analysis involves identifying genes in bacterial genomes that confer resistance to antibiotics. With advancements in sequencing technologies, researchers can now detect these resistance genes directly from sequencing data, enabling proactive monitoring and management of AMR.​

## Understanding the AMR Analysis Pipeline

An AMR analysis pipeline is a systematic workflow that processes raw sequencing data to identify and characterize antimicrobial resistance genes. The primary steps include:​

1. **Quality Control:** Assessing and ensuring the quality of raw sequencing reads to filter out low-quality data.​
2. **Assembly:** Reconstructing the genome from quality-filtered reads.​
3. **Annotation:** Identifying genes and predicting their functions within the assembled genome.​
4. **AMR Gene Detection:** Screening the annotated genome for known resistance genes using specialized databases and tools.​

## Key Tools and Databases
* **MEGARes:** A curated database of antimicrobial resistance genes designed for high-throughput sequencing data analysis. ​
* **AMRFinderPlus:** A tool developed by the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) to identify AMR genes and mutations in bacterial genomes. ​
* **Comprehensive Antibiotic Resistance Database (CARD):** Provides data on the molecular basis of AMR, including resistance genes and their associated phenotypes. ​
* **Resistance Gene Identifier (RGI):** A tool within CARD that predicts resistomes from genomic data based on homology and SNP models. ​
