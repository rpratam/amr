# **Understanding Raw Sequence Data**

In the area of Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS) and Third-Generation Sequencing (TGS), the **FASTQ** format stands as a cornerstone for storing raw sequencing data. This format not only captures the nucleotide sequences but also provides a quality score for each base, offering insights into the reliability of the sequencing process.

## What is a FASTQ File?

A FASTQ file is a text-based format that encapsulates both the raw nucleotide sequences obtained from sequencing platforms and their corresponding quality scores. Originally developed at the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute, it has become the de facto standard for representing sequencing reads, especially from high-throughput technologies like Illumina and Oxford Nanopore.

## Structure of a FASTQ Read

Each sequencing read in a FASTQ file is represented by four distinct lines:

1. **Sequence Identifier Line**: Begins with an '@' symbol, followed by a unique identifier for the read and, optionally, additional descriptive information.

   ```
   @SEQ_ID
   ```

2. **Sequence Line**: Contains the nucleotide sequence, represented by letters such as A, T, C, and G.

   ```
   GATTTGGGGTTCAAAGCAGTATCGATCAAATAGTAAATCCATTTGTTCAACTCACAGTTT
   ```

3. **Plus Line**: Starts with a '+' symbol and may optionally repeat the sequence identifier and description. This line serves as a separator between the sequence and its quality scores.

   ```
   +
   ```

4. **Quality Score Line**: Contains symbols representing the quality scores for each nucleotide in the sequence line. Each character corresponds to a specific quality score based on the ASCII encoding.

   ```
   !''*((((***+))%%%++)(%%%%).1***-+*''))**55CCF>>>>>>CCCCCCC65
   ```

## Understanding Quality (Phred) Scores

Quality scores in a FASTQ file, often referred to as **Phred scores**, quantify the confidence in the accuracy of each base call. The Phred score (Q) is calculated using the formula:


```
Q = -10 × log₁₀(p)
```

Here, **'p'** represents the probability that a particular base call is incorrect. For instance, a Phred score of 20 corresponds to a 1% chance of error (i.e., 99% accuracy), while a score of 30 indicates a 0.1% chance of error (99.9% accuracy).

These scores are encoded using ASCII characters to conserve space. The encoding schemes have evolved over time:

- **Sanger Format (Phred+33)**: Encodes Phred scores from 0 to 93, using ASCII characters 33 to 126. This is the most commonly used encoding in modern sequencing data.

- **Solexa/Illumina Formats**: Earlier versions used different encoding schemes, such as Phred+64, but these have largely been phased out in favor of the Sanger format.

For example, in the Sanger format, an ASCII character '!' (ASCII 33) represents a Phred score of 0, while 'I' (ASCII 73) corresponds to a Phred score of 40.

## Reading a FASTQ File

To interpret a FASTQ file:

1. **Identify the Sequence Identifier**: The first line provides a unique identifier for the read, which can be useful for tracking and referencing specific sequences.

2. **Examine the Nucleotide Sequence**: The second line presents the actual sequence of nucleotides.

3. **Note the Separator**: The third line, starting with a '+', separates the sequence from its quality scores.

4. **Assess Quality Scores**: The fourth line contains characters that, when decoded using the appropriate ASCII offset, reveal the quality scores for each nucleotide.

**Example of a FASTQ Entry:**


```
@SEQ_ID
GATTTGGGGTTCAAAGCAGTATCGATCAAATAGTAAATCCATTTGTTCAACTCACAGTTT
+
!''*((((***+))%%%++)(%%%%).1***-+*''))**55CCF>>>>>>CCCCCCC65
```

In this example:

- **Sequence Identifier**: `@SEQ_ID`

- **Nucleotide Sequence**: `GATTTGGGGTTCAAAGCAGTATCGATCAAATAGTAAATCCATTTGTTCAACTCACAGTTT`

- **Quality Scores**: `!''*((((***+))%%%++)(%%%%).1***-+*''))**55CCF>>>>>>CCCCCCC65`

Each character in the quality score line corresponds to a nucleotide in the sequence line, providing a direct mapping between bases and their confidence levels.

Understanding the FASTQ format and its components is fundamental for anyone working with sequencing data, as it forms the basis for downstream analyses in bioinformatics.
