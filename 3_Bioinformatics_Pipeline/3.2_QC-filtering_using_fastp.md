# **Good Analysis Start from Good Quality Data**

Ensuring the quality of raw sequencing data is a critical initial step in bioinformatics workflows. Raw FASTQ files often contain technical artifacts such as adapter sequences, low-quality bases, and duplicated reads, which can adversely affect downstream analyses. By performing quality checks and filtering, researchers can mitigate these issues, leading to more accurate and reliable results.

## Introduction to fastp

`fastp` is an ultra-fast, all-in-one FASTQ preprocessor designed to provide comprehensive quality control and data filtering for high-throughput sequencing data. Developed in C++ with multi-threading support, `fastp` offers several key features:

- **Adapter Trimming**: Automatically detects and removes adapter sequences from reads.

- **Quality Filtering**: Filters out low-quality reads based on user-defined thresholds.

- **Per-Read Quality Pruning**: Trims low-quality bases from both ends of each read.

- **Duplication Evaluation**: Assesses and removes duplicated reads to reduce redundancy.

Notably, `fastp` performs these operations in a single pass, enhancing processing speed and efficiency compared to traditional methods that require multiple tools and passes. Benchmark evaluations have demonstrated that `fastp` is 2–5 times faster than other FASTQ preprocessing tools like Trimmomatic and Cutadapt, while offering a broader range of functionalities.

## Example Usage of `fastp` for Paired-End Illumina Data

To process paired-end Illumina sequencing data using `fastp`, follow these steps:

1. **Install `fastp`**: If not already installed, you can install `fastp` using `conda`:

   ```bash
   conda install -c bioconda fastp
   ```

2. **Run `fastp`**: Execute the following command to perform quality control and filtering on your paired-end reads:

   ```bash
   fastp -i input_R1.fastq -I input_R2.fastq -o output_R1_filtered.fastq -O output_R2_filtered.fastq -h fastp_report.html -j fastp_report.json
   ```

   **Parameters Explained**:

   - `-i input_R1.fastq`: Specifies the input file for read 1.

   - `-I input_R2.fastq`: Specifies the input file for read 2.

   - `-o output_R1_filtered.fastq`: Specifies the output file for the filtered read 1.

   - `-O output_R2_filtered.fastq`: Specifies the output file for the filtered read 2.

   - `-h fastp_report.html`: Generates an interactive HTML report summarizing the quality control results.

   - `-j fastp_report.json`: Produces a JSON report containing detailed statistics of the processing.

By integrating `fastp` into your preprocessing pipeline, you can efficiently enhance the quality of your sequencing data, thereby improving the reliability of subsequent analyses.
