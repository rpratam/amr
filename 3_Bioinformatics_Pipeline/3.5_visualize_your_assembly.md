# **Visualize your Assembly**

Assessing assembly quality with `quast` give us quantitative metrics which provide valuable insights, however, visualizing the assembly graph offers a more intuitive understanding of the assembly's structure and potential issues. **Bandage** (a **B**ioinformatics **A**pplication for **N**avigating **D**e novo **A**ssembly **G**raphs **E**asily) is a tool designed for this purpose, enabling interactive visualization of de novo assembly graphs.

## Why Visualize Assembly Graphs?

Visualizing assembly graphs is crucial for several reasons:

- **Identifying Assembly Errors**: Graphs can reveal misassemblies, unresolved repeats, or structural variations that might not be evident from linear contig sequences alone.

- **Understanding Complex Regions**: Repetitive or ambiguous regions can cause assembly challenges. Graph visualization helps in pinpointing these areas, facilitating targeted resolution strategies.

- **Improving Assembly Quality**: By examining the graph, researchers can identify and address problematic regions, leading to more accurate and contiguous assemblies.

## Information Gained from Assembly Graphs

Assembly graphs provide insights into:

- **Contig Connectivity**: They display how contigs are linked, highlighting potential gaps or overlaps.

- **Repeat Structures**: Graphs can elucidate the presence and arrangement of repetitive elements within the genome.

- **Structural Variations**: They assist in detecting variations such as duplications, inversions, or translocations.

By leveraging tools like Bandage, researchers can interactively explore these aspects, leading to a more comprehensive understanding of the assembly and informing subsequent analyses or experimental designs.

## Using Bandage

Using Bandage is straightforward and easy to use.
1. Download Bandage for your system at http://rrwick.github.io/Bandage/
2. Install Bandage then open it.
3. Open assembly graph from `shovil` in its output directory: `shovill_output/contigs.gfa`
4. After Bandage finish loading graph, clik **draw graph**
5. Inspect the assembly graph and look for abnormal structures
