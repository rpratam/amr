# **Visualize your Assembly**

Assessing assembly quality with `quast` give us quantitative metrics which provide valuable insights, however, visualizing the assembly graph offers a more intuitive understanding of the assembly's structure and potential issues. **Bandage** (a **B**ioinformatics **A**pplication for **N**avigating **D**e novo **A**ssembly **G**raphs **E**asily) is a tool designed for this purpose, enabling interactive visualization of de novo assembly graphs.

## Why Visualize Assembly Graphs?

Visualizing assembly graphs is crucial for several reasons:

- **Identifying Assembly Errors**: Graphs can reveal misassemblies, unresolved repeats, or structural variations that might not be evident from linear contig sequences alone.

- **Understanding Complex Regions**: Repetitive or ambiguous regions can cause assembly challenges. Graph visualization helps in pinpointing these areas, facilitating targeted resolution strategies.

- **Improving Assembly Quality**: By examining the graph, researchers can identify and address problematic regions, leading to more accurate and contiguous assemblies.

## Information Gained from Assembly Graphs

Assembly graphs provide insights into:

- **Contig Connectivity**: They display how contigs are linked, highlighting potential gaps or overlaps.

- **Repeat Structures**: Graphs can elucidate the presence and arrangement of repetitive elements within the genome.

- **Structural Variations**: They assist in detecting variations such as duplications, inversions, or translocations.

By leveraging tools like Bandage, researchers can interactively explore these aspects, leading to a more comprehensive understanding of the assembly and informing subsequent analyses or experimental designs.

## Using Bandage

Using Bandage is straightforward and easy to use.
1. Download Bandage for your system at http://rrwick.github.io/Bandage/
2. Install Bandage then open it.
3. Open assembly graph from `shovil` in its output directory: `shovill_output/contigs.gfa`
4. After Bandage finish loading graph, clik **draw graph**
5. Inspect the assembly graph and look for abnormal structures

## Interpreting Bandage Visualizations
When examining your assembly graph visualization, consider these key aspects:

**Linear Paths**: Simple, linear connections typically represent well-assembled genomic regions with good coverage and no repetitive elements.
**Complex Tangles**: Highly interconnected regions often indicate repetitive sequences, transposable elements, or areas where the assembler encountered difficulty.
**Isolated Components**: Separate graph components may represent different chromosomes, plasmids, or potential contamination.
**Dead Ends**: Short branches that terminate abruptly might indicate sequencing errors, low-coverage regions, or genuine structural variations.
**Node Coverage**: Node thickness often correlates with sequencing coverage, helping identify regions with unusually high or low coverage.

By integrating Bandage visualization into your assembly workflow, you gain valuable insights into the structural organization of your assembled genome, enabling more informed downstream analyses and quality assessments.
