# **Only have Windows? no Problem, WSL2 got your back**

The integration of bioinformatics tools into research workflows has traditionally been facilitated by UNIX-based operating systems, primarily due to their robust command-line interfaces and compatibility with open-source software. However, many researchers and professionals operate on Windows systems, leading to challenges in accessing and utilizing these bioinformatics tools effectively. The introduction of the Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL), and its enhanced version WSL2, has significantly bridged this gap by allowing Windows users to run a genuine Linux kernel directly within their Windows environment. This development has democratized access to bioinformatics analyses, enabling a broader range of users to implement Linux-based workflows without the need for dual-boot setups or virtual machines.​

## How WSL2 operates?

WSL2 operates by leveraging virtualization technology to run a Linux kernel inside a lightweight utility virtual machine (VM), providing full system call compatibility and improved performance over its predecessor, WSL1. This architecture ensures that bioinformatics tools, which often rely on specific Linux functionalities, operate seamlessly. The process of setting up WSL2 is straightforward: users enable the feature through the Windows Features dialog, install a preferred Linux distribution (such as Ubuntu) from the Microsoft Store, and configure their environment as needed. This setup allows for the installation of essential bioinformatics tools and package managers like Conda or Mamba, facilitating the management of software dependencies and environments. Moreover, WSL2's ability to access the Windows file system ensures smooth interoperability between Windows applications and Linux command-line tools, enhancing the efficiency of data analysis workflows.  ​

## Can WSL2 be used for NGS data analysis?

The adoption of WSL2 in the bioinformatics community has been met with positive feedback. Users have reported successful execution of various bioinformatics workflows, including next-generation sequencing (NGS) data analysis, RNA sequencing, and molecular docking simulations. Using conda as package and environment manager, using bioinformatic tools in WSL2 become seamless and easy to setup.

## How to setup WSL2 on Windows PC

> make sure your PC running Windows 10 version 2004 and higher (Build 19041 and higher) or Windows 11. In addition, you have to enable the <ins>**virtualization setting in BIOS**</ins> to use WSL2. Seek administrator or professionals if you do not understand how to enable the feature.

Installing WSL2 and setup Ubuntu can be done at the same time with only one command. Follow the ssteps below to setup WSL2 and Ubuntu on your Windows PC:
- Open PowerShell with <ins>administrator</ins> right from start menu.
- Type (or copy-paste) the command below to the PowerShell.
```
wsl --install
```
- Hit Enter, wait until WSL2 and Ubuntu installation finish. Stable and fast internet connection usually will take less than 10 minutes of installation time.
- Open **Ubuntu** from Start menu, then input the username of your choice (lowercase only, no space).
- Continue with typing your password. **<ins>ATTENTION:</ins>** when typing your password, it will not be shown on the screen, just keep typing and hit Enter. Retype the password again (not shown) and hit Enter.
- Ubuntu is ready to use
