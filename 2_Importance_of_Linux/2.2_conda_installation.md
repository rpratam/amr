# **Setup Conda on your Ubuntu**

Conda is an open-source package and environment management system that simplifies the process of installing, running, and updating complex software packages and their dependencies. Initially developed for Python programs, Conda has evolved to manage packages from any language, making it particularly beneficial for bioinformatics, where workflows often involve a diverse set of tools and libraries. By creating isolated environments, Conda ensures that specific dependencies do not conflict with one another, facilitating reproducibility and simplifying the management of software versions.

## Benefits of Conda for Bioinformatics Analysis

- **Environment Isolation:** Conda allows users to create multiple isolated environments, each with its own set of packages and dependencies. This isolation prevents conflicts between software tools that may require different versions of the same library, ensuring stable and reproducible analyses.

- **Cross-Platform Compatibility:** Conda is compatible with Windows, macOS, and Linux, providing a unified interface for managing packages across different operating systems. This cross-platform support is particularly advantageous in collaborative environments where researchers may use diverse systems.

- **Extensive Package Repository:** Through channels like Bioconda and Conda-Forge, Conda provides access to a vast repository of bioinformatics tools and libraries. This extensive collection simplifies the installation process, as users can install complex software packages with a single command.

## Step-by-Step Guide to Install Miniconda and Set Up the Bioconda Channel on WSL2

*Assuming you have already installed WSL2 and Ubuntu on your Windows system, follow these steps to install Miniconda and configure the Bioconda channel:*

1. **Update the System:**

   Before installing any new software, it's advisable to update the package lists to ensure you have the latest information about available packages. Open your Ubuntu terminal and execute:

   ```bash
   sudo apt update
   ```

2. **Download the Miniconda Installer:**

   Miniconda is a minimal installer for Conda, including only Conda, Python, and their dependencies. Download the latest Miniconda installer for Linux:

   ```bash
   wget https://repo.anaconda.com/miniconda/Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh
   ```

3. **Verify the Installer's Integrity (Optional but Recommended):**

   To ensure the installer has not been tampered with, verify its SHA-256 checksum. Run cheksum:

   ```bash
   sha256sum ./Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh
   ```

   Compare with the SHA-256 on this page https://repo.anaconda.com/miniconda/. If the checksum identic, the integrity is confirmed.

4. **Run the Miniconda Installer:**

   Make the installer executable and run it:

   ```bash
   bash Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh
   ```

   Follow the on-screen prompts:

   - Review and accept the license agreement by typing `yes`.

   - Confirm the installation location or press Enter to accept the default (`/home/your_username/miniconda3`).

   - Choose whether to initialize Conda by running `conda init`. It's recommended to type `yes` to add Conda to your shell's startup script.

5. **Initialize Conda:**

   Only if you chose `no` to initialize Conda during installation in previous step, you can do so manually:

   ```bash
   source ~/miniconda3/bin/activate
   conda init
   ```

   Restart your terminal or run `source ~/.bashrc` to apply the changes.

6. **Configure the Bioconda Channel:**

   Bioconda is a Conda channel specifically for bioinformatics software. To set it up, you need to add the necessary channels in the correct priority order:

   ```bash
   conda config --add channels conda-forge
   conda config --add channels bioconda
   ```

   This configuration ensures that packages are resolved correctly, with `conda-forge` having the highest priority, followed by `bioconda`.

7. **Verify the Configuration:**

   To confirm that the channels have been added correctly and that Conda is set up as expected, display the current configuration:

   ```bash
   conda config --show
   ```

   Ensure that `conda-forge` and `bioconda` are listed in the channels section in the correct order.

8. **Create and Activate a New Environment (Optional but Recommended):**

   It's good practice to create separate environments for different projects or sets of tools to avoid dependency conflicts:

   ```bash
   conda create -n bioenv
   conda activate bioenv
   ```

   Replace `bioenv` with your preferred environment name.

9. **Install Bioinformatics Packages:**

   With the Bioconda channel configured, you can now install bioinformatics tools inside your environment. For example, to install `samtools`, execute:

   ```bash
   conda install samtools
   ```

   Conda will handle the installation of `samtools` along with any necessary dependencies.

10. **Deactivate the Environment:**

    After completing your work, you can deactivate the current environment:

    ```bash
    conda deactivate
    ```
