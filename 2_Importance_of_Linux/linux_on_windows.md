# Only have Windows? no Problem, WSL2 got your back

The integration of bioinformatics tools into research workflows has traditionally been facilitated by UNIX-based operating systems, primarily due to their robust command-line interfaces and compatibility with open-source software. However, many researchers and professionals operate on Windows systems, leading to challenges in accessing and utilizing these bioinformatics tools effectively. The introduction of the Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL), and its enhanced version WSL2, has significantly bridged this gap by allowing Windows users to run a genuine Linux kernel directly within their Windows environment. This development has democratized access to bioinformatics analyses, enabling a broader range of users to implement Linux-based workflows without the need for dual-boot setups or virtual machines.​

## How WSL2 operates?

WSL2 operates by leveraging virtualization technology to run a Linux kernel inside a lightweight utility virtual machine (VM), providing full system call compatibility and improved performance over its predecessor, WSL1. This architecture ensures that bioinformatics tools, which often rely on specific Linux functionalities, operate seamlessly. The process of setting up WSL2 is straightforward: users enable the feature through the Windows Features dialog, install a preferred Linux distribution (such as Ubuntu) from the Microsoft Store, and configure their environment as needed. This setup allows for the installation of essential bioinformatics tools and package managers like Conda or Mamba, facilitating the management of software dependencies and environments. Moreover, WSL2's ability to access the Windows file system ensures smooth interoperability between Windows applications and Linux command-line tools, enhancing the efficiency of data analysis workflows. For detailed instructions on setting up WSL2 for bioinformatics purposes, resources like the ARTIC Network's bioinformatics protocol provide comprehensive guidance. ​

# Can WSL2 be used for NGS data analysis?

The adoption of WSL2 in the bioinformatics community has been met with positive feedback. Users have reported successful execution of various bioinformatics workflows, including next-generation sequencing (NGS) data analysis, RNA sequencing, and molecular docking simulations. For instance, the ARTIC Network provides a comprehensive bioinformatics protocol that guides users through setting up a functional environment using WSL2, enabling them to perform analyses such as consensus genome sequence generation from sequencing data. Additionally, discussions on platforms like Reddit highlight that while WSL2 is effective for many bioinformatics tasks, the performance is inherently linked to the underlying hardware. For computationally intensive analyses, leveraging remote high-performance computing clusters or cloud-based services may be advisable. ​
